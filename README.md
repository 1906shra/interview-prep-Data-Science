# Data Science Interview Questions Repository

Welcome to the **Data Science Interview Questions** repository! This project aims to compile a comprehensive and well-organized collection of interview questions that cover all the essential topics in data science. Whether you're preparing for a job interview or looking to brush up on your knowledge, this repository will be a valuable resource.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a curated list of interview questions organized by key topics within data science, including but not limited to:

- **NumPy**: Fundamental questions on array manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: Essential questions on data manipulation, analysis, and handling.
- **Machine Learning**: Core questions on algorithms, models, and practical scenarios.
- **Statistics**: Important questions covering statistical concepts and their application.
- **Python**: General programming questions relevant to data science.

Each set of questions is organized in order of importance, with the most critical and frequently asked questions listed first. Additionally, scenario-based and practical questions are provided to test your understanding in real-world applications.
